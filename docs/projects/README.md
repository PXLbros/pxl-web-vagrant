# Projects

**PXL Web Vagrant** makes it easy to [create new](/projects/create-new.html) as well as [adding existing](/projects/add-existing.html) projects through [`.pxl-vagrant/config.yaml`](/projects/configuration.html#config-yaml) configuration file and helpful built-in [`create_project`](/projects/commands.html#create-project) and [`delete_project`](/projects/commands.html#delete-project) shell commands.
